It rained the past two weekends in Montreal, so I decided to make a silly little app called Booknook for any readers out there that want an app like goodreads, with less functionalities, but is prettier :) to track the books you read each year. You can find the app at laurenrowe.xyz, I also made this project open source on GitHub if you want to clone it, or make suggestions/improvements at https://github.com/Lauren2544/Booknook

Todo 
- [x] add cute little plant image 
- [x] make book title verticle 
- [x] make a default state (when no books added): have a shelf with a add button and no date always (bottom shelf)
- [x] fix the problem with the year
- [x] make "add book" look like a book (title and author gets added to front, you can also add images to the front, and it will add the image to the spine as well, then inside date read, rating, quotes, looking like a book with lined lines and little arrows at the bottom to switch pages to add more notes or quotes)
- [x] fix login redirection issue

- [x] proper shelves
