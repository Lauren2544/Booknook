## Booknook

It rained the past two weekends in Montreal, so I built Booknook â€” a simple and prettier alternative to Goodreads for tracking the books you read each year.

## Getting Started

The project is open source, so feel free to clone the repo, explore the code, and submit suggestions or pull requests! Any help or feedback is appreciated, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
